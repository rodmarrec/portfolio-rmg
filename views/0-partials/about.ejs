                    <h4>
                        Greetings!
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I was born in Mexico City. I was raised in Sugar Land/ Houston, TX and traveled to Mexico as often as I could. The constant experiences with Mexico's rich culture and history set me on my path to wanting to become an architect. <br> My undergrad and professional career in architecture gave me minimal, yet sufficient, exposure to coding to know this was something special I really wanted to learn and be a part of.
                        <br><br>
                        Fast forward to mid 2020. I had been laid off due to the pandemic and I was struggling to find work in the architecture/ construction industries. My partner and I realized there would never be a better time to make the career pivot I had been yearning for but hadn't made. In August 2020 I enrolled in General Assembly's 12-week Software Engineering Immersive-Remote Program and buckled up!
                        <br><br>
                        Today I can proudly say that I am an architect, designer, and project manager turned full stack software engineer. Iâ€™m driven by the increasing demand for adult up/re-skilling and I want to create new inroads for people through the digital products I help build.
